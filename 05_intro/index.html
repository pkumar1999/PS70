      <p> Today, I got to mess around with 3d structures in Fusion 360. I was able to make a lampshade, following a similar pattern to that of the youtube channel of Fusion 360. I also downloaded the Prusa Slicer which seems like the software needed to take our files (.stl) and then actually make it into a 3D printable file. I am pretty familiar with this software, but I learned about the Sketch Inspect function and the Projection Sketch function, which are super helpful! Below is what I created in Fusion, followed by what the Prusa slicer spits out. </p>
