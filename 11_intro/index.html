  <h3>Week 11: Final Project Planning </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> For my final project, I will be working to make a symphony of speakers, an idea I mentioned at the beginning of the semester. The idea is to connect either via bluetooth/wifi and transmit MIDI files to multiple Huzzah boards. If done on bluetooth, this will require High Data Bluetooth, something I haven't worked on yet. However, via WiFi this should be functional similar to the SONOS speaker brand. I imagine that I should be able to do this via FireBase from which I can write songs and then play them on the speaker. I could attach the LED Strip to make the lights to react with it. I've been researching more on bluetooth speakers and found this project on the Arduino board, but have been struggling to figure the one input to multiple output, so Wifi might be the best play</p>

      <h1> Parts I Have </h1>
      <p>1 Huzzah, Wires, 1 Speaker Driver, 4 Amps, Soldering Iron and Solder, Box for frame of speaker (Could be 3D printed but seems a little excessive with current conditions</p>

      <h1> Parts I Will Need </h1>
      <p>Another Huzzah, Another Speaker Driver (maybe multiple), Some sort of library that can change songs to MIDI files. </p>
