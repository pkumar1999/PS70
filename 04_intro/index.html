  <h3>Week 4: Arduino </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    
      <p> I was sick this week so didn't get to do to much, yet I managed to fix the connection of my Arduino to my laptop (Wasn't hookeed up to the right mode. However, I started coding to make my Arduino have 3 parallel lights that all run in sync and pulse on and off in sequence. Still learning in progress so will update soon.</p>

       <p> Update: I have gotten to work a bunch more with Arduino so this seems like a good time to update this page. I think the most basic program was the blink program that simply connected the light to the port, and then upon a stimulus from the board allows the light to turn on. Additionally, I have gotten to use the button, which one can use to change an input, like a light from turning on and off</p>
