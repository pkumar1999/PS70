  <h3>Final Project</h3> <br> 


  <div class="row">
    
      <p> For my final project, I have several avenues I am interested in pursuing. One is a product idea I have had: A headphone plug that can be plugged into multiple speakers so that both (all) speakers play the same sound at the same time. I don't know the feasibility of this but I am interested in learning.</p>

      <p> Another possibility is learning more about how to engineer organs or cells using modified 3d Printers or other techniques taught in this class. </p>
